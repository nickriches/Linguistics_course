The term "Mood" refers to a speaker's ATTITUDE towards the sentence they are producing. There are four main types of mood; DECLARATIVE, IMPERATIVE, INTERROGATIVE, and EXCLAMATIVE. Term "modality" relates to the two concepts; OBLIGATION (or DEONTIC modality), and POSSIBILITY (or EPISTEMIC modality). It is generally regarded as a subcomponent of "mood". Voice refers to the devices used by a language to FOREGROUND or TOPICALISE particular arguments. English has an active voice (Subject is the topic) and  PASSIVE VOICE (non-subject is promoted to topic position). Some linguists have also identified a "middle" voice.
