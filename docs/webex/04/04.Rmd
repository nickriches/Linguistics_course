A morpheme is the s`r fitb("mallest", width = "8")` unit of m`r fitb("eaning", width = "8")`. They can either be f`r fitb("ree", width = "8")` or b`r fitb("ound", width = "8")`. There are two types of b`r fitb("ound", width = "8")` morpheme: d`r fitb("erivational", width = "8")` morphemes and i`r fitb("nflectional", width = "8")` morphemes.

I`r fitb("nflectional", width = "8")` morphemes `r mcq(c(answer = "are involved in syntactic processes", "are not involved in syntactic processes"))`, `r mcq(c(answer = "are subject to phonological processes", "are not subject to phonological processes"))`, are `r mcq(c(answer = "productive", "not very productive"))` and `r mcq(c("can come at both the beginning and ends of words", answer = "can only come at the ends of words"))`

D`r fitb("erivational", width = "8")` morphemes `r mcq(c("are involved in syntactic processes", answer = "are not involved in syntactic processes"))`, `r mcq(c("are subject to phonological processes", answer = "are less subject to phonological processes"))`, are `r mcq(c("productive", answer = "not very productive"))` and `r mcq(c(answer = "can come at both the beginning and ends of words", "can only come at the ends of words"))`

There are two w`r fitb("ord", width = "8")` f`r fitb("ormation", width = "8")` processes: d`r fitb("erivational", width = "8")` morphology and c`r fitb("ompounding", width = "8")` (joining multiple words together)

In child language, the average number of morphemes per sentences is often described as the M`r fitb("ean", width = "8")` L`r fitb("ength", width = "8")` of U`r fitb("tterance", width = "8")`.

A morpheme is the SMALLEST unit of MEANING. They can either be FREE or BOUND. There are two types of BOUND morpheme: DERIVATIONAL morphemes and INFLECTIONAL morphemes.

INFLECTIONAL morphemes ARE INVOLVED IN SYNTACTIC PROCESSES, ARE SUBJECT TO PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES are PRODUCTIVE and CAN ONLY COME AT THE END OF WORDS

DERIVATIONAL morphemes ARE NOT INVOLVED IN SYNTACTIC PROCESSES, ARE LESS SUBJECT TO PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES, are LESS PRODUCTIVE and CAN COME AT THE BEGINNINGS AND ENDS OF WORDS.

There are two WORD FORMATION processes: DERIVATIONAL morphology and COMPOUNDING (joining multiple words together)

In child language, the average number of morphemes per sentences is often described as the MEAN LENGTH OF UTTERANCE.
