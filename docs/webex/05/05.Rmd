# Morphological representation and processing

A variety of data support a c`r fitb("omputational", width = "8")` account of morphological representation / processing

(1) We can use morphemes prod`r fitb("uctively", width = "8")`, e.g. wug-s.

(2) Morphological errors, e.g. omission, substitution and str`r fitb("anding", width = "8")` errors, suggest separate storage of roots and affixes.

(3) According to theories of morpho-phonological p`r fitb("arsing", width = "8")` we actively seek out phonetic material which *could potentially* be a regular affix.

(4) Ph`r fitb("onotactic", width = "8")` evidence suggests regular forms are generated, rather than lexically-stored.

By contrast, whole-word acccounts are supported by

(1) existence of non-word roots, e.g. un-re-*mitt*-ing-ly

(2) Morphemes with multiple meanings pose a difficulty for computational accounts.

(3) Psycho`r fitb("linguistic", width = "8")` studies, e.g. Losiewisz (1995), Alegre & Gordon (1999)

A variety of data support a COMPUTATIONAL account of morphological representation / processing

(1) We can use morphemes PRODUCTIVELY, e.g. wug-s.

(2) Morphological errors, e.g. omission, substitution and STRANDING errors, suggest separate storage of roots and affixes.

(3) According to theories of morpho-phonological PARSING we actively seek out phonetic material which *could potentially* be a regular affix.

(4) PHONOTACTIC evidence suggests regular forms are generated, rather than lexically-stored.

By contrast, whole-word acccounts are supported by

(1) existence of non-word roots, e.g. un-re-*mitt*-ing-ly

(2) Morphemes with multiple meanings pose a difficulty for computational accounts.

(3) PSYCHOLINGUISTIC studies, e.g. Losiewisz (1995), Alegre & Gordon (1999)

# Pinker and Ullman's The dual route model

According to the d`r fitb("ual", width = "15")` r`r fitb("oute", width = "15")` model, past tense verbs are generated via either a l`r fitb("exical", width = "15")` or a g`r fitb("rammatical", width = "15")` route.

The former involves an`r fitb("alogical", width = "15")` and fr`r fitb("equency", width = "15")`-driven processes, while the latter involves co`r fitb("mputational", width = "15")` processes. The former involves the de`r fitb("clarative", width = "15")` memory system, while the latter involves the pr `r fitb("ocedural", width = "15")` memory system.

If the pr`r fitb("ocedural", width = "15")` memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of `r mcq(c("regular", answer = "irregular"))` verbs than `r mcq(c(answer = "regular", "irregular"))` verbs.

If the de`r fitb("clarative", width = "15")` memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of `r mcq(c(answer = "regular", "irregular"))` verbs than `r mcq(c("regular", answer = "irregular"))` verbs.

Which of the following is NOT characterised by by better performance on irregulars than regulars? `r mcq(c("Parkinson's", answer = "Alzheimers", "Developmental Language Disorder", "Agrammatic non-fluent Aphasia (Broca's type"))`

The term ps`r fitb("eudo", width = "15")`-regularity describes the phenomenon whereby the irregular system mimics the regular system.

`r hide("Show answers")`

According to the DUAL ROUTE model, past tense verbs are generated via either a LEXICAL or a GRAMMATICAL route.

The former involves ANALOGICAL and FREQUENCY-driven processes, while the latter involves COMPUTATIONAL processes. The former involves the DECLARATIVE memory system, while the latter involves the PROCEDURAL memory system.

If the PROCEDURAL memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of IRREGULAR verbs than REGULAR verbs.

If the DECLARATIVE memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of REGULAR verbs than IRREGULAR verbs.

Which of the following is NOT characterised by by better performance on irregulars than regulars? ALZHEIMMER'S

The term PSEUDO-regularity describes the phenomenon whereby the irregular system mimics the regular system.
