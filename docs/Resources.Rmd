# Introduction to Linguistic Theory

__READINGS:__

Borjars & Burridge, Chapter 1

Steven Pinker’s The Language Instinct, Chapter 12, The Language Mavens This is a brilliant demolition of prescriptive grammars.

Pullum, G. (1999) [African American Vernacular English is not standard English with mistakes](www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/aave-is-not-se-with-mistakes.pdf). In R. S. Wheeler (Ed.), The workings of language From prescriptions to perspectives (pp. 39-58). Westport, CT Praeger.

In addition you can read [this chapter](old chapters/1_introduction_reduced.pdf) from a book I wrote to accompany last year's course. I will no longer be using this book, as the course structure has changed quite a lot, but when certain chapters are relevant I will provide links to them.
