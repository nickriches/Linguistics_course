# Linguistics

Welcome to the course in Linguistics! If you wish to access this page outside of Blackboard please go to ![https://nickriches.github.io/linguistics_course/](https://nickriches.github.io/linguistics_course/)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
