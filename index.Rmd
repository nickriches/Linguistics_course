# Introduction

## Brief overview of the course

The course covers topics in syntax (sentence structure) and semantics (linguistic meaning) with a clinical focus. It adopts a mainly descriptive approach, describing language structure rather than trying to explain it. Nonetheless there will be brief introductions to linguistic theories (Construction Grammar and Chomskyan Generative Linguistics).

## Getting help

I can be contacted on <a href="mailto:nick.riches@newcastle.ac.uk">nick.riches@newcastle.ac.uk</a>. My office is Room 1.9 on the left hand side on the way to Fozzie the photocopier. On my door is a picture "Captain Auxiliary Verb," a superhero I have invented which could possibly be my gateway to fame and fortune.

I have three drop-in sessions:

1. Monday 12 - 1 (slot available for MScs only)
2. Tuesday 12 - 1 (slot available for BScs only)
3. Tuesday 4 - 5 (slot available for Mscs and BScs)

Please feel free to just 'drop in' (but please also contact me in advance if at all possible)

# Reading materials

## Main reading materials

The main text is **Borjars, K., & Burridge, K. (2010). Introducing English Grammar (2nd ed.). Hodder Education.** [(this link will take you to the library website where you can see available copies)](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2162237630002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,borjars%20burridge&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443135978&offset=0)

There is also an excellent book on linguistics which is written for speech and language therapists **McAllister, J., & Miller. J (2012). Introductory Linguistics for Speech and Language Therapy Practice. Wiley-Blackwell.**  [(library link)](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2161387180002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,mcallister%20miller&sortby=rank&offset=0)

**Crystal, P. D. (2004). Rediscover Grammar (2nd ed.). Longman.** is a good reference book for learning grammatical, but be warned, occasionally his use of terminology is slightly idiosyncratic [(library link)](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2156538420002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,crystal%20rediscover&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443230234&offset=0)

## Secondary readings

The library has a wide range of introductory books on linguistics.

_Black, M., & Chiat, S. (2003). Linguistics for Clinicians A Practical Introduction. Hodder Education_ is specifically designed for clinicians, so you might wish to take a look at this. However, the book does involve a fairly steep learning curve.

The following two books are good introduction to generative (Chomskyan) linguistic theory. Be warned, they contain lots of syntactic trees, which we will cover only briefly in the course. The Carnie is exception- ally readable, and probably the best introduction to generative linguistic theory I have come across.

1. _Carnie, A. (2002). Syntax a generative introduction. Blackwell Pub._
2. _Haegeman,L. (1994). Introduction to Government and Binding Theory (2nd ed.). Wiley-Blackwell._

_Burton-Roberts, P. N. (2010). Analysing Sentences Introduction to English Syntax (3rd ed.). Pearson Longman._ is another good introduction, written broadly within the generative framework. Again, it contains trees!

## Further reading

_Pinker, S. (1994). The Language Instinct. The Penguin Group._
is probably the best all-round introduction to linguistics and language psychology. It is written with real verve and panache, and is immensely readable. However, Pinker is sometimes guilty of simplifying facts to suit has argument (it is popular science after all).

If you wish to read about non-generative approaches, Adele Goldberg has written a couple of great books, but some mind find them difficult.

1. _Goldberg, A. E. (1995). Constructions a Construction Grammar approach to argument structure. University of Chicago Press._
2. _Goldberg, A. E. (2006). Constructions at Work The Nature of Generalization in Language. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press._

## Main readings for topics in semantics

The two main semantics texts are;

1. _Saeed, J. I. (2010). Semantics. John Wiley & Sons._ [library link](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA21122130560002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,semantics&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443482684&offset=0)
2. _Cruse, A. (2010). Meaning in Language An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics: OUP Oxford._ [library link](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2159351000002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,cruse%20meaning&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443131633&offset=0)

The Saeed book is better for topics in sentence meaning, e.g. propositions, arguments, tense and aspect. The Cruse book is better on lexical semantics (word meaning)

# Seminars

In Semester 1, there will be seminars on Friday 11 - 1 in weeks 3, 5, 8 and 10. I will upload exercises the week before.

Friday 19th October: [Questions](seminars/S01 - Seminar 1.pdf) and [Answers](seminars/S01 - Seminar 1_plus_answers.pdf)

# Assessment

## BScs

There will be **two one-hour exams**, one at the end of Semester 1 (January, 2019), and one at the end of Semester 2 (May 2019)

## MScs

MScs will do the **exam in Semester 2 only** (May 2019). At the end of Semester 1, you will do a **Semantic Analysis exercise** (analysing the argument atructure of sentences in clinical data). The motivation for this additional assessment is that this is an important topic which does not appear in the Semester 2 exam

## Exam content

The Semester 1 exam will contain questions on the following topics.

1. Labelling syntactic functions using LARSP
2. Labelling semantic relations (argument structure)
3. Discussing psycholinguistic models and data
4. Discussing clinical materials and data
5. A mini-essay question on any topic which we have covered.

The Semester 2 exam will contain questions on the following topics.

1. Labelling syntactic functions using LARSP
2. Labelling dependent clauses
3. Labelling tense, aspect and voice
4. Discussing psycholinguistic models and data
5. Discussing clinical materials and data
6. A mini-essay question on any topic which we have covered

Later this semester, I will post up example questions for you to look at.

# Tables

This section is for links to interactive tables which are used to demonstrate linguistic concepts. There is a table on [word classes](html/word_classes.html), and I may make some more!

# Linguistics on Twitter

Good hashtags to follow in Twitter are #slpeeps, the main hashtag for speech and language therapists, #lingthusiasm, by Gretchen McCulloch a self-employed internet linguist who does great podcasts and blogs, and #lynneguist, by Lynne Murphy who writes on the similarities and differences between British and American English.

The world is your twoyster!
