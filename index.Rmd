# Introduction

## Brief overview of the course

The course covers topics in syntax (sentence structure) and semantics (linguistic meaning) with a clinical focus. It adopts a mainly descriptive approach, describing language structure rather than trying to explain it. Nonetheless there will be brief introductions to linguistic theories (Construction Grammar and Chomskyan Generative Linguistics).

## Getting help

I can be contacted on <a href="mailto:nick.riches@newcastle.ac.uk">nick.riches@newcastle.ac.uk</a>. My office is Room 1.9 on the left hand side on the way to Fozzie the photocopier. On my door is a picture "Captain Auxiliary Verb," a superhero I have invented which could possibly be my gateway to fame and fortune.

My Drop-in Session for Semester 2 is at 12 - 1 on a Wednesday

Please feel free to just 'drop in' (but please also contact me in advance if at all possible)

# Reading materials

## Main reading materials

The main text is **Borjars, K., & Burridge, K. (2010). Introducing English Grammar (2nd ed.). Hodder Education.** [(this link will take you to the library website where you can see available copies)](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2162237630002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,borjars%20burridge&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443135978&offset=0)

There is also an excellent book on linguistics which is written for speech and language therapists **McAllister, J., & Miller. J (2012). Introductory Linguistics for Speech and Language Therapy Practice. Wiley-Blackwell.**  [(library link)](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2161387180002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,mcallister%20miller&sortby=rank&offset=0)

**Crystal, P. D. (2004). Rediscover Grammar (2nd ed.). Longman.** is a good reference book for learning grammatical, but be warned, occasionally his use of terminology is slightly idiosyncratic [(library link)](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2156538420002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,crystal%20rediscover&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443230234&offset=0)

## Secondary readings

The library has a wide range of introductory books on linguistics.

_Black, M., & Chiat, S. (2003). Linguistics for Clinicians A Practical Introduction. Hodder Education_ is specifically designed for clinicians, so you might wish to take a look at this. However, the book does involve a fairly steep learning curve.

The following two books are good introduction to generative (Chomskyan) linguistic theory. Be warned, they contain lots of syntactic trees, which we will cover only briefly in the course. The Carnie is exception- ally readable, and probably the best introduction to generative linguistic theory I have come across.

1. _Carnie, A. (2002). Syntax a generative introduction. Blackwell Pub._
2. _Haegeman,L. (1994). Introduction to Government and Binding Theory (2nd ed.). Wiley-Blackwell._

_Burton-Roberts, P. N. (2010). Analysing Sentences Introduction to English Syntax (3rd ed.). Pearson Longman._ is another good introduction, written broadly within the generative framework. Again, it contains trees!

## Further reading

_Pinker, S. (1994). The Language Instinct. The Penguin Group._
is probably the best all-round introduction to linguistics and language psychology. It is written with real verve and panache, and is immensely readable. However, Pinker is sometimes guilty of simplifying facts to suit has argument (it is popular science after all).

If you wish to read about non-generative approaches, Adele Goldberg has written a couple of great books, but some mind find them difficult.

1. _Goldberg, A. E. (1995). Constructions a Construction Grammar approach to argument structure. University of Chicago Press._
2. _Goldberg, A. E. (2006). Constructions at Work The Nature of Generalization in Language. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press._

## Main readings for topics in semantics

The two main semantics texts are;

1. _Saeed, J. I. (2010). Semantics. John Wiley & Sons._ [library link](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA21122130560002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,semantics&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443482684&offset=0)
2. _Cruse, A. (2010). Meaning in Language An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics: OUP Oxford._ [library link](https://libsearch.ncl.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NCL_ALMA2159351000002411&context=L&vid=NEWUI&lang=en_US&search_scope=NotPC&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,cruse%20meaning&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,1443131633&offset=0)

The Saeed book is better for topics in sentence meaning, e.g. propositions, arguments, tense and aspect. The Cruse book is better on lexical semantics (word meaning)

# Seminars

# Assessment

## BScs

There will be **two one-hour exams**, one at the end of Semester 1 (January, 2019), and one at the end of Semester 2 (May 2019). Each will constitute 50% of the overall mark.

Click [here](other/Semester 1 - mock exam.docx) to download the Semester 1 practice. [This](other/LARSP symbols.pdf) is the list of symbols you will be given to use in the exam. The answers the practice exam are [here](other/Semester 1 - mock exam - plus answers.docx)

Click [here](other/Semester 2 - Practice Exam.docx) to download the Semester 2 practice exam.
  
## MScs

MScs will do the **exam in Semester 2 only** (May 2019) which will constitute 35% of the overall mark. At the end of Semester 1, you will do a *Semantic Analysis exercise* (analysing the argument structure of sentences in clinical data), which will constitute 35% of the overall mark. The motivation for this additional assessment is that this is an important topic which does not appear in the Semester 2 exam. Here is the [original assignment brief](other/MSc Semantic Analysis Exercise.docx), and here is the [slightly modified brief](other/MSc Semantic Analysis Exercise - changes in response to student queries.docx) in response to student queries.

Click [here](other/Semester 2 - Practice Exam.docx) to download the Semester 2 practice exam.

The additional 30% of your grade will be made up by the bilingualism essay.

## Exam content

The Semester 1 exam will contain questions on the following topics.

1. Labelling syntactic functions using LARSP
2. Labelling semantic relations (argument structure)
3. Discussing psycholinguistic models and data
4. Discussing clinical materials and data
5. A mini-essay question on any topic which we have covered.

The Semester 2 exam will contain questions on the following topics.

1. Labelling syntactic functions using LARSP
2. Labelling dependent clauses
3. Labelling tense, aspect and voice
4. Discussing psycholinguistic models and data
5. Discussing clinical materials and data
6. A mini-essay question on any topic which we have covered

Later this semester, I will post up example questions for you to look at.

# Linguistics on Twitter

Good hashtags to follow in Twitter are #slpeeps, the main hashtag for speech and language therapists, #lingthusiasm, by Gretchen McCulloch a self-employed internet linguist who does great podcasts and blogs, and #lynneguist, by Lynne Murphy who writes on the similarities and differences between British and American English.

The world is your twoyster!

# MiMo

MiMo is a tool I am developing which helps you to explore linguistic data. It can be found at [https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/MiMo_v1/](https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/MiMo_v1/).

You can use it to learn word classes. You can either.

(1) **Work with random text, e.g. from a news website**. Label the word classes in the text, then check your answers using MiMo.

or

(2) **Create sentences containing particular word classes**. For example, if you are not sure about prepositions, try creating sentences with prepositions. Then enter the text into MiMo to see if it agrees with you!

NB the part-of-speech tagger which MiMo uses is not 100% accurate. I've noticed the *some* subordinating conjunctions, e.g. <u>**When** I fall in love </u>, are labelled as Adverbs. This is not so silly as the word *When* could be regarded as referring to a missing Adverbial Phrase, e.g. *I fall in love [ever year]*. So the decision-making process is nearly always logical.
